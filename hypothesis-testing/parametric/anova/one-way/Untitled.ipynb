For example, if the assumption of normality is violated, a non-parametric test such as the Kruskal-Wallis test may be more appropriate. If the assumption of homogeneity of variance is violated, a Welch's ANOVA or a robust ANOVA may be used instead.\n",

    "Suppose you want to compare the means of three independent groups. If you conduct three independent t-tests (Group 1 vs. Group 2, Group 1 vs. Group 3, Group 2 vs. Group 3), you are essentially testing the null hypothesis three times, which increases the overall probability of making a type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true). For example, if you use an alpha level of .05 for each t-test, the probability of making at least one type I error across all three tests is $1 - (1-.05)^3 = 0.143$, or a $14.3$% chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a one-way ANOVA simultaneously tests whether there are any significant differences between any of the groups, while controlling for the overall type I error rate at the specified alpha level. The F-test in the one-way ANOVA compares the ratio of the variance between groups to the variance within groups, which increases the power (sensitivity) of the test to detect real differences between the groups. By using a one-way ANOVA instead of multiple t-tests, you reduce the risk of mistakenly concluding that there are significant differences between groups when there are not."
